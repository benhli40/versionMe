# 🧠 VersionMe

> *Your personal changelog. Because life is just one big refactor.*

**VersionMe** is a self-tracking, soul-patching, semi-sarcastic dev tool that lets you log personal updates like you're maintaining a human API. Every click generates a new version number and a delightfully unhinged patch note.

No frameworks. No backends. Just vanilla JS, vibes, and chaos.

## ✨ Features

- 🔢 Semantic version bumps (`v2.4.9`, `v3.0.1`, `v0.0.1-beta`)
- 💬 30+ hilarious self-update messages like:
  - *Minor update: made tea.*
  - *Rollback: attempted multitasking. Disaster.*
  - *Bug fix: stopped overthinking one thing.*
- 📜 Version history log with localStorage memory
- 🧹 Clear history button for when you need to "hard reset your personality"
- 🪄 Whimsical UI with just the right amount of pastel existentialism

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with big cozy energy)
- JavaScript (ES Modules, no frameworks)
- Your soul, probably

## 🗂 Example Output

v3.1.4 – UX improvement: made bed. Felt powerful. v3.2.0 – Experimental build: wore mismatched socks. Own it. v4.0.0 – Major update: survived another Monday.

## 🎯 Why?

Because being a developer means:
- Logging bugs and emotions
- Rolling back decisions
- Deploying new identities daily

And because **you deserve a changelog as weird as you are**.

## 🧹 Reset Your Life (Temporarily)

Click the **Clear History** button and pretend none of it happened.  
Congratulations. You're now `v0.0.0` again.  
A fresh Git init. A blank README. A bug-free psyche (not guaranteed).
